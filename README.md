**Apache Status & Info** is a WordPress plugin that generates specific rewrite rules for [server-info](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/mod_info.html) and [server-status](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/mod/mod_status.html) Apache modules and allows to monitor Apache right in the WordPress admin.

When you want to use [server-info](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/mod_info.html) and/or [server-status](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/mod/mod_status.html) with Apache server, you must modify (right in your `.htaccess` file) the rewrite rules generated by WordPress. And you must do it each time WordPress modify and regenerates the rules.
**Apache Status & Info** do it for you, without you having to intervene. Just activate it and that's it!

In addition to this, **Apache Status & Info** allows you to monitor your Apache configuration and settings, right in your WordPress admin.

See [WordPress directory page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/htaccess-server-info-server-status/).
