Apache server-info and server-status monitoring right in your WordPress admin.

== Description ==
When you want to use [server-info](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/mod_info.html) and/or [server-status](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/mod/mod_status.html) with Apache server, you must modify (right in your `.htaccess` file) the rewrite rules generated by WordPress. And you must do it each time WordPress modify and regenerates the rules.
**Apache Status & Info** do it for you, without you having to intervene. Just activate it and that's it!

In addition to this, **Apache Status & Info** allows you to monitor your Apache configuration and settings, right in your WordPress admin (see screenshots for example).
