Automatically add rules to .htaccess file to support server-info and server-status Apache mod.

== Description ==
When you want to use [server-info](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/mod_info.html) and/or [server-status](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/mod/mod_status.html) with Apache server, you must modify (right in your .htaccess file) the rewrite rules generated by WordPress. And you must do it each time WordPress modify and regenerates the rules.
Apache Status & Info do it for you, without you having to intervene. Just activate it and that's it!
