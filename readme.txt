Automatically add rules to .htaccess file to support server-info and server-status Apache mod.

== Description ==
When you want to use [server-info](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/mod_info.html) and/or [server-status](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/mod/mod_status.html) with Apache server, you must modify (right in your .htaccess file) the rewrite rules generated by WordPress.
